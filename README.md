# Simple_Checkers_with_Alpha_Beta_Algorithm - Python

This is my project for the Artificial Intelligence course during Spring 2018. Please find the project goal in the file 'Project- Checkers _CS 4613-6613 Spr 18_'.

Find the tools required to run my code and project writeup in the file 'Checkers_Project_Report.pdf'.

I will further try to improvise this by implementing a GUI. Currently, it works only in command line.

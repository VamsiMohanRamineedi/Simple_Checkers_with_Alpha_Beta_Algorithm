# Simple_Checkers_with_Alpha_Beta_Algorithm - Python

This is my project for the Artificial Intelligence course during Spring 2018. Please find the project goal in the file 'Project- Checkers _CS 4613-6613 Spr 18_'.

* Built a mini-checkers game of board size 6x6 squares where a human can play against a computer.
* Implemented alpha-beta search for picking the next best move for the computer.
* Designed 3 difficulty levels based on how deep the computer looks for the best move in the search tree, and the heuristics used in the evaluation function.
* Tools used: Object-oriented programming in python, numpy, random libraries.
